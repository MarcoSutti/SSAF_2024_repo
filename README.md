This is a collection of MATLAB files associated with the preprint [A single shooting method with approximate Fréchet derivative for computing geodesics on the Stiefel manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04089).

We propose a single shooting method with approximate Fréchet derivative (SSAF).

If there are any problems or bugs, feel free to [contact me](mailto:msutti@ncts.ntu.edu.tw).

If you use SSAF for your research, please kindly cite the following preprint:
